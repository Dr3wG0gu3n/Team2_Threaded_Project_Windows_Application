Team2_Threaded_Project_Windows_Application
==========================================

Our Windows Desktop Application
For the 2nd Part of our Course, Team 2 is/was comprised of Yu Wen Ruan, Vishnukumar Guntuka , Chris Kostashuk,
and myself Andrew Goguen.

This project is made up of 2 parts, 1 a desktop (Windows) application used by Travel Agents to manage their Suppliers,
Products, Travel Packages and the relationship between those items. 

The Desktop Application will have a master form, calling 3 child forms. Each one designed to work with a specific table.
ex.You will be able to add / delete / edit suppliers. You will be able to link those suppliers with existing products
  or create a new product specific to that supplier. You will be able to add / edit / link / unlink products. You will
  NOT be able to delete a product once it has been added to the database. You may unlink it from a supplier.  You will
  be able to create / edit / update / and delete Travel Packages.
  
  The application will allow for searching for a specific supplier either by Id (primary key) or by Name.
  When the supplier is found a form loads with all relevant info displayed. The user can then edit or delete the supplier
  or add products to the supplier.  MAYBE CALL A NEW PRODUT FORM?????  We will then be able to edit the relationship between
  supplier and product, either adding a new product or adding relationship between existing products.
